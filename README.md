## Project Description
This project seeks to extract and visualize all road networks within the boundaries of Accra, Ghana, using data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database and the visualization capabilities of Matplotlib library. Through the use of the osmnx library, the project is able to extract the road networks and plot them on a map, providing a detailed visual representation of the road infrastructure in Accra. Additionally, various metrics such as road lengths and types are also extracted and analyzed to provide a deeper understanding of the road networks within Accra. The project serves as a useful tool for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers interested in understanding and analyzing the road infrastructure of Accra, as well as for anyone interested in data visualization techniques.
